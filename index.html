        <h2>How Sealing Services Prevent Moisture Damage and Surface Deterioration</h2>
        <p>Water infiltration is a leading cause of surface deterioration in concrete, wood, and asphalt. When moisture seeps into these materials, it weakens their structure, leading to cracks, mold growth, and decay. Sealing services create a protective layer that repels water and prevents these issues, ensuring that surfaces remain strong and intact.

        <h2>Factors That Determine How Often Sealing Services Are Needed</h2>
        <p>
The frequency of sealing depends on the type of surface, weather conditions, and level of usage. Driveways and patios typically require resealing every two to three years, while deck sealing services may need to be applied annually. High-traffic commercial spaces may benefit from more frequent applications of epoxy concrete sealing services to maintain durability and safety.
